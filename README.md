Weather App

We want to build an app (web or mobile) that forecasts the weather.

Feature requirements:

We should have the ability to query a city by 1) name; and 2) longitude and latitude


You can assume all of the queries relate to cities in the US


The first time the user comes to the site, we want the query to be by their current location


After the query we want to present the user the temperature, humidity and pressure in the location they chose in a graph/s of some sort 

Notes:
How the app looks is entirely up to you. Don’t worry too much about the design. Simple UI and graphs are okay
Please use React / JS to build it (though you can use whatever language you’d prefer)
Please use this API. You can create an API key by subscribing to their service. Here’s a data sample
We’d prefer you submit with a link to the Github repo where you put the exercise

What we are looking for in order of importance:

Scalable architecture. We are looking for an individual who can carry the architecture of the app. This means thing should be done efficiently within the code.
Clean and readable code. Avoid duplicated, redundant code or outdated syntax


Optional features for bonus points (Not required! Only do these if you feel you have time)

Query a city by zip code
The ability to toggle easily between Fahrenheit and Celsius
